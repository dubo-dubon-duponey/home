# DNS zone management

This module is meant to update and maintain my own DNS zones on Gandi (farcloser.world specifically):

 * hosts A records
 * services CNAME
 * protonmail configuration

As such, it is of little interest (except as inspiration) to anyone.

To use, you need to gandi provider.

On mac:

```
brew install dubo-dubon-duponey/brews/terraform-provider-gandi
```

Then review the configuration in variables.tf.
